# DataManager's autodoc Guide (Sphinx)
Brief guide to illustrate the autodoc generation process.

## Script to generate data-manager auto docs

We need to define the environment variables to run the code. In this case, we use some sample values.
In addition to that, we have to add the package to ** PYTHONPATH** to avoid problems with imports

	#!/usr/bin/env bash
	SOURCE_CODE_PATH=data_manager_package/

	export API_PORT=5001
	export WEB_PORT=3000
	export DB_PORT=27020
	export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:$HOME/code/sonda-docker/data-manager/$SOURCE_CODE_PATH"

After that, we can generate the docstrings using sphix-apidoc

	. venv/bin/activate
	cd docs/ && make clean && cd ..
	rm -Rf docs/source/docstring/*
	sphinx-apidoc -e -f -o docs/source/docstring/ $SOURCE_CODE_PATH
	cd docs/ && make html && cd ..
	
	
	
## Code structure
All the code needs to be contained in a package. In this case, **data_manager_package**. The global project folder needs to contain this package along with the **docs/** folder.

Each folder requires an **\__init__.py** file to be interpreted by Sphinx as a module.

## Docs generation
To generate the code, you have to execute, from the global project directory:

	./build_docs
	
	
## Access the docs
The autogenerated docs are accessible by opening the index.html file with any browser

	firefox docs/build/html/index.html
